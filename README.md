# Social-Network-Node-Analysis-and-Community-Mining

## Task Description:

a) Apply a community mining algorithm to partition the network into different communities and visualize the result (specific visualization tools are not strictly required).

b) Perform further analysis of the network, such as applying various node centrality metrics to identify and highlight the most influential/authoritative/central nodes. Present various network attribute measurement results (such as average distance between nodes, degree distribution, graph/community diameter, network structure evolution, etc.) using graphs, tables, etc.

## Bonus Tasks (Optional, choose one):

1. **Link Prediction**: Use the information provided by the network dataset to design a machine learning model to predict the formation of edges in the network. Also, explain the performance evaluation methods and results of the prediction model. Depending on the network dataset, link prediction can correspond to different application tasks, such as friend prediction, scientific collaboration prediction, purchase behavior prediction, etc.

2. **Node Classification**: Design a model to classify the nodes in the network and explain the performance evaluation methods and results. Depending on the dataset, the task can involve binary classification or multi-class classification.
